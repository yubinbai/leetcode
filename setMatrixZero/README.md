Problem
===

Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.


Follow up:
Did you use extra space?
A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

Solution
====

Use first row and first col as markers
