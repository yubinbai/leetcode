===

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Hint:

Try to utilize the property of a BST.
What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).

The author tries to make you answer "order statistic tree" for the question follow-up, found in "Introduction to algorithms"
