Problem
===
Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from start to end, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
For example,

    Given:
    start = "hit"
    end = "cog"
    dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    Return
      [
        ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
        ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
      ]
    Note:
    All words have the same length.
    All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
