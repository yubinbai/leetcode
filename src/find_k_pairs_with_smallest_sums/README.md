Problem
===

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.


Solution
===

Find all possible pairs and sort

O(k^2 logk)
