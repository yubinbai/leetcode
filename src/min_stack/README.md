Min Stack
===

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

    push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
    pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
    top() -- Get the top element.
    getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

Solution
===

Keep an auxilary stack for the min, update as elements are moved around
